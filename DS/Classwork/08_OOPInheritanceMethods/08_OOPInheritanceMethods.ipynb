    "# Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows us to reuse the code of an existing class `B`\n",
    "in creating a new class `C`.\n",
    "Let’s recap how the attribute lookup worked for classes.\n",
    "When looking for an attribute, the lookup procedure starts\n",
    "with the instance dictionary, and continues with the class\n",
    "attributes.\n",
    "If both fail, then the attribute is searched from the base\n",
    "classes and, recursively, from their base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, it may look like we access an attribute of a class `C`, when\n",
    "in reality we are accessing the attribute of its base class `B`.\n",
    "In this case we say that the class `C` *inherits* the attribute from\n",
    "its base class `B`.\n",
    "If we have attributes with the same name in both the class\n",
    "and its base class, the attribute of the base class is hidden.\n",
    "We say that the class `C` overrides the attribute of the base\n",
    "class `B`.\n",
    "Terminology: `B` is a base class and `C` is a derived class.\n",
