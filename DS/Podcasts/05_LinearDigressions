The fourth podcast for TTS 2020.08.18's DS Course is A Data Science Take on Open Policing Data, by Linear Digressions, a conversation about the intersection of data science with race and racism, recorded in Early July 2020 after the death of George Floyd. We begin by talking with socially conscious Todd Hendricks. He works in the Bay Area in Data Science in the renewable energy industry.

Thoughts:
The context of the data is as important as the data itself. Remembering that data is not unbiased and complete always, that there are layers in how data is collected which skews the data science. Using Regular Expressions to process the strings given for "reason for stop" is important and interesting.
